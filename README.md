# Cloud Computing - AWS

### What is cloud computing?
- Cloud computing is the practice of storing IT resources on platforms accessible from the web. These platforms often belong to third-party service providers, the major ones being Amazon, Google and Microsoft.

#### What are the benefits of cloud computing?
- Cloud computing has many benefits in comparison to local storage:

	* The code/services are available to anyone with the appropriate credentials from anywhere in the world with an Internet connection. Teams can use this property to collaborate on a project with ease and flexibility
	* Being centralised services, could computing providers take great care to ensure the safety, security and stability of the uploaded content to a greated extent that would otherwise be possible for a detail operation
	* Cloud computing in its current form allows for a great deal of scalability. Code-bases and services that were developed for hundreds of customers can be converted to serve tens, hundreds or even millions with ease.
	* GO GLOBAL IN MINUTES!
	
#### What are the use cases of cloud computing?
- Some of the many use cases in which it's and advantage to use cloud computing is when applying Infrastructure as a Service, Software as a Service, Big Data Analytics, software testing and development and many more. 

#### What is AWS and what are its advantages?
- Amazon Web Services is the biggest provider of cloud computing services to date. Among its many advantages there are great ease of use, speed and efficiency, competitive costs and reliability.
- Really big companies, like for example Netflix, Coca Cola, Facebook and Linkedin.

### Styles of computing:
- On cloud
- On premises (public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud)
- Hybrid (banks, Government orgs, etc)

#### Some examples: Netflix
- Autoscaling to adapt to the traffic
- When a certain treshold is met, the service scales up automatically
- When the traffic diminishes, the service scales down again
- Lots of cost-saving
- This is SaaS/PaaS

#### Scaling up/out
- Scaling out is adding more, similar resources in order to spread the traffic load *out*
- Scaling up in increasing the baseline capabilities of your resources

#### Monolithic Architecture vs Tiered Architecture

###### Naming convention for launching an AWS machine:
- group name + your name + app
- Security group works as firewall for the instance of your machine
- key pair: DevOps Students
